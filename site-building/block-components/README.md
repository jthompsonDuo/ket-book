# Layout Builder

Drupal's Layout Builder allows content editors and site builders to easily and quickly create visual layouts for displaying content. Users can customize how content is arranged on a single page, and even create custom landing pages with an easy to use drag-and-drop interface.

The Layout Builder provides the ability to drag and drop site-wide blocks and content fields into regions within a given layout. Additionally, custom "inline" blocks can be created for one-off details specific to a given layout.

### Content types with Layout Builder

There are three content types on Kettering.edu that include Layout Builder: Landing, Basic, and Department. As its name suggests, the Landing content type is 100% layout builder, so each page is a completely custom layout. The Basic and Department content types are hybrid pages, combining several fields which are always displayed in the same location and style, and a layout builder component that allows site builders to add custom layouts and styles.

### Using Layout Builder

As mentioned previously, not all content types have the need for Layout Builder. Landing, Basic and Department pages will have administration tabs that include the tab **“Layout’**. The other content types will only have the View, Edit, Delete tabs.&#x20;
