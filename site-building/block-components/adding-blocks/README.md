# Blocks

### Add Content (Blocks)

Once a section is added, it’s time to add content to your layout. Each column (or region) has an “Add Block” link.. Clicking “Add Block” opens a dialog where you can choose the content to add.

Note that while these links are labeled "Add Block", and the dialog is titled "Choose a block" the items that can be added extend well beyond what is available in Drupal's Block UI. In addition to all blocks available in Block UI, you can create custom blocks that are only used within the Layout and add fields belonging to the current entity or user.

1. Clicking "Create Custom Block" allows you to create a custom block that is only available to the Layout - not visible in Block UI. Clicking this will take you to a second form: "Add new inline block". You can choose any of your sites' custom Block types.
2. Clicking the Block type will take you to the custom Block creation form. Each Block type will have a "Title" field, "Display Title" checkbox, and then the custom Block type fields.
3. Once complete, click the "Add Block" to add the new block to your layout.
