#### Primary colors

The primary color palette is considered: Kettering Blue, Kettering Yellow, Grey, and White. These colors will be used throughout the site, and are a key visual element of the Kettering brand. Using grey and white are significant in maintaining the right color balance on each page.&#x20;

#### Accent colors

The accent colors work in conjunction with the primary Kettering color palette. Each accent color has been mapped to an area of study/school. As a general rule, these colors should be used on their corresponding school or degree pages. Avoid using multiple accent colors on pages as the color coding will be diminished and the over use of color can become distracting or busy.
